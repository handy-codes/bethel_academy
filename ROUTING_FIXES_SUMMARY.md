# Routing Issues Fixed - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Double Topbars Issue**
**Problem**: The `LayoutWrapper` was adding a `Navbar` to ALL pages, including admin and student dashboards that already have their own headers.

**Solution**: Updated `app/components/LayoutWrapper.tsx` to exclude dashboard routes (`/admin`, `/student`, `/lecturer`) from getting the main navbar.

**Before**: All pages got the main navbar + their own headers = double topbars
**After**: Only public pages (home, college, tutorials, etc.) get the main navbar

### 2. ✅ **Forced Redirect to /student Issue**
**Problem**: The middleware was defaulting to 'student' role when it couldn't detect the user's role, causing unwanted redirects.

**Solution**: Updated `middleware.ts` to:
- Remove the default 'student' role fallback
- Only redirect when a role is actually detected
- If no role is detected, allow the user to stay where they are
- Added comprehensive debugging logs

### 3. ✅ **Role Detection Issues**
**Problem**: Admin users weren't being properly detected, causing them to be redirected to student dashboard.

**Solution**: 
- Verified `paxymek@gmail.com` has admin role set in Clerk
- Enhanced middleware debugging to show exactly what's happening
- Improved role detection logic

## Current System Behavior

### **Home Page (`localhost:3000/`)**
- **Public page**: Shows the main Bethel Academy website with navbar and footer
- **For signed-in users**: Redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role
- **For users without role**: Stays on home page (no forced redirect)

### **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)**
- **Access**: Only for users with 'admin' role
- **Layout**: Admin header + sidebar (no main navbar)
- **Features**: User management, exam management, question bank, results

### **Student Dashboard (`/student`)**
- **Access**: Only for users with 'student' role  
- **Layout**: Student header + sidebar (no main navbar)
- **Features**: Take exams, view results, dashboard

### **Lecturer Dashboard (`/lecturer`)**
- **Access**: Only for users with 'lecturer' role
- **Layout**: Lecturer header + sidebar (no main navbar)
- **Features**: Manage courses, view student progress

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Test Admin Login**
```bash
# Make sure admin role is set
node scripts/set-user-role.js paxymek@gmail.com admin

# Then sign in with paxymek@gmail.com
# Should redirect to /admin (not /student)
```

### 2. **Test Routing**
Visit `http://localhost:3000/test-routing` to see:
- Current path
- User status
- Role detection
- Metadata information

### 3. **Check Console Logs**
The middleware now logs detailed information:
```
=== MIDDLEWARE DEBUG ===
Path: /admin
User ID: user_2qj71tvbC2bOTHrm3usRUziR1Fx
Session Claims: {...}
Detected Role: admin
========================
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **LayoutWrapper.tsx**
```typescript
// Added dashboard routes to exclusion list
const dashboardRoutes = ['/admin', '/student', '/lecturer'];
const isDashboardRoute = dashboardRoutes.some(route => pathname.startsWith(route));

if (isAuthRoute || isDashboardRoute) {
  return <>{children}</>; // No navbar/footer for dashboards
}
```

### 2. **middleware.ts**
```typescript
// Removed default 'student' role
const userRole = sessionClaims?.publicMetadata?.role || 
                sessionClaims?.privateMetadata?.role || 
                sessionClaims?.metadata?.role;

// Only redirect if role is detected
if (!userRole) {
  console.log('No role detected, allowing access to:', pathname);
  return; // Don't redirect
}
```

### 3. **Added Test Route**
- Created `/test-routing` page for debugging
- Shows user info, role detection, and navigation links

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **Sign in with `paxymek@gmail.com`** → Should go to `/admin`
2. **Sign in with student account** → Should go to `/student`  
3. **Visit home page while signed in** → Redirects to appropriate dashboard
4. **Visit home page while not signed in** → Stays on home page
5. **No more double topbars** on any dashboard
6. **No more forced redirects** to `/student`

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check browser console** for middleware debug logs
2. **Visit `/test-routing`** to see role detection
3. **Verify user role** with: `node scripts/set-user-role.js email@example.com admin`
4. **Clear browser cache** and try again

The routing system should now work correctly without the stubborn redirects to `/student`!
